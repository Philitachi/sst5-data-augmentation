1,"in the process of trimming the movie to an expeditious 84 minutes , director roger kumble seems to have dumped a whole lot of plot in favor of ... outrageous gags ."
1,this slender plot feels especially thin stretched over the nearly 80-minute running time .
1,the movie 's biggest shocks come from seeing former nymphette juliette lewis playing a salt-of-the-earth mommy named minnie and watching slim travel incognito in a ridiculous wig no respectable halloween costume shop would ever try to sell .

1,the characters never change .
1,even kids deserve better .
1,"while scorsese 's bold images and generally smart casting ensure that `` gangs '' is never lethargic , the movie is hindered by a central plot that 's peppered with false starts and populated by characters who are nearly impossible to care about ."
1,into how long is this movie ?
1,and for all the wrong reasons besides .

1,good-looking but relentlessly lowbrow outing plays like clueless does south fork .
1,suffers from all the excesses of the genre .
1,"this rather unfocused , all-over-the-map movie would be a lot better if it pared down its plots and characters to a few rather than dozens ... or if it were subtler ... or if it had a sense of humor ."

1,the troubling thing about clockstoppers is that it does n't make any sense .
1,uneven performances and a spotty script add up to a biting satire that has no teeth .
1,you do n't know whether to admire the film 's stately nature and call it classicism or be exasperated by a noticeable lack of pace .

1,a sloppy slapstick throwback to long gone bottom-of-the-bill fare like the ghost and mr. chicken .
1,"scotland , pa is entirely too straight-faced to transcend its clever concept ."
1,the movie is about as deep as that sentiment .
1,"brainless , but enjoyably over-the-top , the retro gang melodrama , deuces wild represents fifties teen-gang machismo in a way that borders on rough-trade homo-eroticism ."
1,"as violent , profane and exploitative as the most offensive action flick you 've ever seen ."

1,"suspend your disbelief here and now , or you 'll be shaking your head all the way to the credits ."
1,nothing more than four or five mild chuckles surrounded by 86 minutes of overly-familiar and poorly-constructed comedy .
1,the satire is just too easy to be genuinely satisfying .
1,"the biggest problem i have -lrb- other than the very sluggish pace -rrb- is we never really see her esther blossom as an actress , even though her talent is supposed to be growing ."
1,-lrb- moore 's -rrb- better at fingering problems than finding solutions .
1,"-lrb- green is -rrb- the comedy equivalent of saddam hussein , and i 'm just about ready to go to the u.n. and ask permission for a preemptive strike ."
1,"once again , director chris columbus takes a hat-in-hand approach to rowling that stifles creativity and allows the film to drag on for nearly three hours ."

1,"if swimfan does catch on , it may be because teens are looking for something to make them laugh ."
1,"while the film is competent , it 's also uninspired , lacking the real talent and wit to elevate it beyond its formula to the level of classic romantic comedy to which it aspires ."
1,the locale ... remains far more interesting than the story at hand .
1,"releasing a film with the word ` dog ' in its title in january lends itself to easy jokes and insults , and snow dogs deserves every single one of them ."
1,"the film would have been more enjoyable had the balance shifted in favor of water-bound action over the land-based ` drama , ' but the emphasis on the latter leaves blue crush waterlogged ."
1,"a disaster of a drama , saved only by its winged assailants ."

1,"nothing here seems as funny as it did in analyze this , not even joe viterelli as de niro 's right-hand goombah ."
1,"too predictably , in fact ."
1,"jaw-droppingly superficial , straining to get by on humor that is not even as daring as john ritter 's glory days on three 's company ."
1,"if you go into the theater expecting a scary , action-packed chiller , you might soon be looking for a sign ."
1,could this be the first major studio production shot on video tape instead of film ?
1,it 's loud and boring ; watching it is like being trapped at a bad rock concert .
1,i suspect that you 'll be as bored watching morvern callar as the characters are in it .
1,"despite the opulent lushness of every scene , the characters never seem to match the power of their surroundings ."
1,-lrb- the film 's -rrb- taste for `` shock humor '' will wear thin on all but those weaned on the comedy of tom green and the farrelly brothers .
1,only about as sexy and dangerous as an actress in a role that reminds at every turn of elizabeth berkley 's flopping dolphin-gasm .
1,i 'm left slightly disappointed that it did n't .
1,"entertaining enough , but nothing new"
1,"a non-britney person might survive a screening with little harm done , except maybe for the last 15 minutes , which are as maudlin as any after-school special you can imagine ."
1,"piccoli 's performance is amazing , yes , but the symbols of loss and denial and life-at-arm 's - length in the film seem irritatingly transparent ."
1,"it 's clear why deuces wild , which was shot two years ago , has been gathering dust on mgm 's shelf ."
1,drowning 's too good for this sucker .
1,as inept as big-screen remakes of the avengers and the wild wild west .
1,everything -- even life on an aircraft carrier -- is sentimentalized .
1,"it 's an odd show , pregnant with moods , stillborn except as a harsh conceptual exercise ."
1,"there 's an admirable rigor to jimmy 's relentless anger , and to the script 's refusal of a happy ending , but as those monologues stretch on and on , you realize there 's no place for this story to go but down ."
1,"i 'll stay with the stage versions , however , which bite cleaner , and deeper ."
1,"it 's a movie that ends with truckzilla , for cryin ' out loud ."
1,they just do n't work in concert .
1,an unintentionally surreal kid 's picture ... in which actors in bad bear suits enact a sort of inter-species parody of a vh1 behind the music episode .
1,it 's not original enough .
1,this 100-minute movie only has about 25 minutes of decent material .
1,"attal 's hang-ups surrounding infidelity are so old-fashioned and , dare i say , outdated , it 's a wonder that he could n't have brought something fresher to the proceedings simply by accident ."

1,hip-hop prison thriller of stupefying absurdity .
1,a domestic melodrama with weak dialogue and biopic cliches .
1,almost as offensive as `` freddy got fingered . ''
1,imagine susan sontag falling in love with howard stern .
1,"there 's no point of view , no contemporary interpretation of joan 's prefeminist plight , so we 're left thinking the only reason to make the movie is because present standards allow for plenty of nudity ."
1,the sequel plays out like a flimsy excuse to give blade fans another look at wesley snipes ' iconic hero doing battle with dozens of bad guys -- at once .
1,steven soderbergh does n't remake andrei tarkovsky 's solaris so much as distill it .

2,"this boisterous comedy serves up a cruel reminder of the fate of hundreds of thousands of chinese , one which can only qualify as a terrible tragedy ."
2,"the rest of the plot is impossible to explain without blowing whatever tension there is , although it 's more comedy than suspense de palma creates ."

2,high on melodrama .
2,"thankfully , the film , which skirts that rapidly deteriorating line between fantasy and reality ... takes a tongue-in-cheek attitude even as it pushes the croc hunter agenda ."
2,the am-radio soundtrack and game cast -- tierney and the inimitable walken especially -- keep this unusual comedy from choking on its own conceit .
2,"the story , like life , refuses to be simple , and the result is a compelling slice of awkward emotions ."
2,"yes , 4ever is harmless in the extreme and it 'll mute your kids for nearly 80 minutes , but why not just treat the little yard apes to the real deal and take them to spirited away ?"
2,"the movie addresses a hungry need for pg-rated , nonthreatening family movies , but it does n't go too much further ."

2,occasionally amateurishly made but a winsome cast and nice dialogue keeps it going .
2,"sure , it 's more of the same , but as the film proves , that 's not always a bad thing ."
2,the average local news columnist has a bigger rant on the war between modern landscape architecture and small-town america .
2,"however clever nelson has been in providing variation within the confines of her structure and staging , the question remains whether this should , indeed , have been presented as a theatrical release ."
2,this ill-fitting tuxedo is strictly off-the-rack .
